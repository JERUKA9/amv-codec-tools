Testing instructions ;)

Make sure you've got a fresh copy of the sourcecode:

$ svn update

Compile the patched FFmpeg - AMV-support is now build in:
$ make build

Grab sample files (hole.avi and hole_correct.amv) from 
http://code.google.com/p/amv-codec-tools/downloads/list
and put them to this directory.

Test it by converting the testvideo hole.avi to hole.amv:

$ make test

Now compare this to the correct hole_correct.amv and fix those bugs !
