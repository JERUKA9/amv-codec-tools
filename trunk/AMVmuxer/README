Testing instructions ;)

Make sure you've got a fresh copy of the sourcecode:
1.- svn update

Patch the FFmpeg sourcecode so that our code is build into FFmpeg:
2.- From this dir run ./srcprepare.sh /path/to/clean/FFmpeg/repo
    (a new dir with ffmpeg sources is created here before being patched, your
    repo stays untouched)

Compile the patched FFmpeg - AMV-support is now build in:
3.- cd ffmpeg
4.- ./configure
5.- make
6.- cd ..

Test it by converting the testvideo hole.avi to hole.amv:
6.- ./testconvert

Now compare this to the correct hole_correct.amv and fix those bugs !
