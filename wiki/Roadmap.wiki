= Introduction =

We should first agree on the general roadmap we're going to follow in this project.


= Roadmap =

Here's the general outline Reynaldo suggested:

  # Finish the MTV demuxer at FFmpeg (works but has problems)
  # Code a MTV muxer for ffmpeg
  # Reverse engineering of the ACT audio/speech codec
  # Code an AMV demuxer for FFmpeg
  # Code an AMV muxer for FFmpeg

Tom is woundering why we need the MTV stuff; can't we leave out steps 1 and 2 or finish them when the rest is finished ? Reynaldo, what do you suggest ?
